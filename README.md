# What is JDAEventer?

JDAEventer is a JDA Library for a better event system, currently pretty small but many features still coming.

JDAEventer aims to manage your events better than regular ListenerAdapter

# Features

- No more reason to use specific method named method for event to work
- priorities for events
- better management for all your listeners (well not really possible now)
- Very easy to use, if you already use regular jda listeners switching isn't hard
- Remove all listeners related to a listener class using its class
- Add some information to an event for other listeners to know about
- Fire Custom Events!

# How to integrate to your project

The library is in alpha. Until now there is no major release, or major alpha release, you can get the latest snapshot version from

# Javadoc

Javadoc can be found [here](https://ci.bluetree242.tk/job/JDAEventer/javadoc/index.html)

# How to use

```java
public class Bot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JDAEventer eventer = new JDAEventer();
        JDA jda; //init your jda instance here
        jda.addEventListener(eventer.getRootListener()); //if you want add this in the builder of jda
        //now forget about registering events from jda, register them in eventer!
        eventer.addListener(new MessageListener());
    }

}

public class MessageListener implements DiscordListener {

    @HandleEvent //default priority is NORMAL
    public void onMessage(MessageReceivedEvent e, EventInformation info) { //method name doesn't matter anymore, info is optional
        info.addNote("wasListened", true);
        //some code
    }

    @HandleEvent(priority = HandlerPriority.MONITOR) //monitor means your listener will be the last to be called, you shouldn't delete message here 
    public void onLastListenMessage(MessageReceivedEvent e, EventInformation info) { //info is optional, if you don't need it then don't add it
        System.out.println(info.getNoteBoolean("wasListened")); //should print true
    }

    //onMessage() will be called before onLastListenMessage()! This guarantee that wasListened is true unless another third handler removes it.
}
```

# Recommendations

- Don't delete message (or remove reaction in reaction event etc) if its MONITOR, if you wish you should use HIGHEST
  priority

# Planned Features

- ~~Marking events as cancelled~~ Added
- ~~Adding event notes, for other listeners to read and know some information (for example let other listeners know if
  this message isn't regular and is a command)~~ Added
- Schedule an event to run for temporary time, and removes itself (or manually but easy)
- Limit a listener to a specific guild, in 1 line of code!
- And MANY MORE!
